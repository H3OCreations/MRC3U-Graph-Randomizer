# MRC3U-Graph-Randomizer
The following program takes in a class list from TeachAssist and generates a class set of graphs using Matplotlib and LaTeX.  
The program generates the following functions: quadratic, exponential, sine, and cosine.  

As of right now, the program is having issues centering graphs and creating appropriate thresholds for the graphs
The second graph is also not functioning well as it is plotting on top of the previous graph rather than creating its own subplot
